== Introduction

DarkRadiant is a level editor for Doom 3 and The Dark Mod. It creates `.map`
files which are loaded by the game at runtime, and compiled into processed
geometry (`.proc` files) using the game engine's integrated `dmap` tool.
DarkRadiant does not include any game assets itself, but makes use of a game
installation elsewhere on the system.

=== Editing workflow

The level editing process starts off with basic assets: models, textures,
sounds, entity definitions, skins, animations and so on. Many of these assets
will be packaged with a particular game installation, but a level designer may
also choose to create custom assets for a specific mission. These assets are
installed into a directory tree which is accessible both by DarkRadiant (for
editing) and the game engine itself (for playing the mission).

Once assets have been arranged in DarkRadiant according to the wishes of the
level designer, a `.map` file is saved to disk. This is a text file in a format
understood by the game engine, and includes both level geometry and references
to the assets used in the map. Since the `.map` file is simply text, and does
not actually embed the binary asset data, it tends to be fairly small.

The game engine includes functionality to _compile_ the `.map` file into a
`.proc` file containing low-level vertex geometry derived from the brushes and
patches within the `.map` file. The game engine can then render the mission in
realtime, making use of the same assets that were accessed by DarkRadiant during
editing.

DarkRadiant also maintains its own separate file containing various editing
information, such as object layers used within a map. This `.darkradiant` file
is never used by the game engine, and is non-critical --- a `.map` file with no
accompanying `.darkradiant` file can still be edited with DarkRadiant, although
certain DarkRadiant-specific state may be lost.

== Initial configuration

=== Choosing a game type

When running DarkRadiant for the first time, the *Game Setup* dialog will be
shown. This is where you configure the path to the game installation from which
DarkRadiant will load assets, such as textures, models and entity definitions.

The *Game Setup* dialog allows configuration of the following options:

*Game Type*:: DarkRadiant ships with support for several different game engines,
 each of which is contained within a `.game` file. For editing Dark Mod
 missions, the default choice of `The Dark Mod 2.0 (Standalone)` is the one to
 use, but it is also possible to edit stock Doom 3 or Quake 4 missions.

*DarkMod Path* / *Engine Path*:: This is the path to the game installation on
 the system. The label text will change depending on whether the selected game
 is `The Dark Mod` or another engine.

*Mission*:: Optional path to a subdirectory containing assets specific to a
 particular mission which is being worked on. For game types other than `The
 Dark Mod`, this will be displayed as *Mod (fs_game)*, and should be set to the
 path of a subdirectory containing a particular game mod, if one is being used.

*Mod Base (fs_game_base)*:: This field only appears for non-DarkMod game types.
 It allows a two-level mod structure, where the *Mod Base* can point to a major
 game mod, possibly downloaded from elsewhere, while *Mod* can be set to point
 to an entirely local "sub-mod" which contains local changes and overrides.
 Before the release of Dark Mod standalone, this field would have been set to
 `darkmod` while the *Mod* field would have been set to the local mission,
 however this is no longer necessary when `The Dark Mod 2.0 (Standalone)` is
 being used.

Once the game paths are set up, click the *Save* button to proceed to the main
DarkRadiant interface.

NOTE: It is possible to *Cancel* the *Game Setup* dialog and proceed to the main
window without configuring a game installation, in which case DarkRadiant will
show a warning and ask if you wish to proceed. If you do, DarkRadiant will run
but there will be no available textures, models, entities or other game assets.

=== Interface layout

DarkRadiant ships with a number of different user interface layouts, which
control the position, visibility and window type of the major interface
elements. The current layout can be changed from the `View -> Window Layout`
menu, and will require DarkRadiant to be restarted.

There is currently no support for custom layouts, however all of the provided
layouts allow window sizes and splitter positions to be changed, and the changes
will persist through multiple editing sessions.

*Embedded*:: A large 2D window is shown on the right, while the left-hand side
 is divided vertically into the 3D camera window and a tab widget containing the
 main editing panels. There are no floating subwindows in this layout.

*Regular*:: A legacy GtkRadiant layout which places the 2D window on the left,
 the 3D camera view on the top right, and a 2D scrolling textures panel on the
 bottom right. Other tabs in the editing panel are shown in a floating window.

*RegularLeft*:: The same as *Regular* except the full-height 2D window is on the
 right and the 3D window and texture panels are on the left.

*Floating*:: The 2D window, 3D window and editing tab widget are all shown in
 separate floating windows which always appear above the main DarkRadiant
 window. The main window itself is empty apart from the toolbars and status bar.
 This is the most flexible layout, since each subwindow can be sized or
 positioned as desired, but the multiple subwindows may be cumbersome to manage.

*SplitPane*:: Three separate 2D windows, showing each of the major axes, are
 shown alongside the 3D camera view in a 2x2 layout similar to traditional 3D
 modelling applications. The editing tab widget is in a floating window.
