== Introduction

DarkRadiant is a level editor for Doom 3 and The Dark Mod. It creates `.map`
files which are loaded by the game at runtime, and compiled into processed
geometry (`.proc` files) using the game engine's integrated `dmap` tool.
DarkRadiant does not include any game assets itself, but makes use of a game
installation elsewhere on the system.

== File types

There are three main types of files encountered when building levels with DarkRadiant.

`.map`:: The map file contains all of the brushes, patches and entities
contained within the map. It is loaded and saved by DarkRadiant, and loaded by
the game engine itself.

`.proc`:: The proc file contains compiled geometry which the game engine's
`dmap` tool generates from the brushes and patches in the `map` file. The proc
file cannot be loaded or saved by DarkRadiant, and is used only by the game
engine.

`.darkradiant`:: This is an extra file used by DarkRadiant itself to store extra
editing-related information that cannot easily be represented in the `map` file
(whose format is tightly determined by the game engine). A `.darkradiant` file
is not used by the game itself, and is not critical for editing, however without
the `.darkradiant` file certain features (such as object groups) may be lost.

== First time setup

When running DarkRadiant for the first time, the *Game Setup* dialog will be
shown. This is where you configure the path to the game installation from which
DarkRadiant will load assets, such as textures, models and entity definitions.

The *Game Setup* dialog allows configuration of the following options:

*Game Type*:: DarkRadiant ships with support for several different game engines,
 each of which is contained within a `.game` file. For editing Dark Mod
 missions, the default choice of `The Dark Mod 2.0 (Standalone)` is the one to
 use, but it is also possible to edit stock Doom 3 or Quake 4 missions.

*DarkMod Path* / *Engine Path*:: This is the path to the game installation on
 the system. The label text will change depending on whether the selected game
 is `The Dark Mod` or another engine.

*Mission*:: Optional path to a subdirectory containing assets specific to a
 particular mission which is being worked on. For game types other than `The
 Dark Mod`, this will be displayed as *Mod (fs_game)*, and should be set to the
 path of a subdirectory containing a particular game mod, if one is being used.

*Mod Base (fs_game_base)*:: This field only appears for non-DarkMod game types.
 It allows a two-level mod structure, where the *Mod Base* can point to a major
 game mod, possibly downloaded from elsewhere, while *Mod* can be set to point
 to an entirely local "sub-mod" which contains local changes and overrides.
 Before the release of Dark Mod standalone, this field would have been set to
 `darkmod` while the *Mod* field would have been set to the local mission,
 however this is no longer necessary when `The Dark Mod 2.0 (Standalone)` is
 being used.

Once the game paths are set up, click the *Save* button to proceed to the main
DarkRadiant interface.

NOTE: It is possible to *Cancel* the *Game Setup* dialog and proceed to the main
window without configuring a game installation, in which case DarkRadiant will
show a warning and ask if you wish to proceed. If you do, DarkRadiant will run
but there will be no available textures, models, entities or other game assets.
