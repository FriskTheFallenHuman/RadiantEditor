== Introduction

DarkRadiant is a level editor for Doom 3 and The Dark Mod, developed by The Dark
Mod team. It may also be used for editing levels for similar *id Software* games
such as Quake 4.

This User Guide describes the features and functionality of DarkRadiant, however
it is not intended as a guide to mapping techniques. Level design is a complex
topic, and is covered by various other learning resources, some of which are
listed below.

=== Editing workflow

image::DarkRadiantWorkflow.png[align="center"]

The level editing process starts off with basic assets: models, textures,
sounds, entity definitions, skins, animations and so on. Many of these assets
will be packaged with a particular game installation, but a level designer may
also choose to create custom assets for a specific mission. These assets are
installed into a directory tree which is accessible both by DarkRadiant (for
editing) and the game engine itself (for playing the mission).

Once assets have been arranged in DarkRadiant according to the wishes of the
level designer, a `.map` file is saved to disk. This is a text file in a format
understood by the game engine, and includes both level geometry and references
to the assets used in the map. Since the `.map` file is simply text, and does
not actually embed the binary asset data, it tends to be fairly small.

The game engine includes functionality to _compile_ the `.map` file into a
`.proc` file containing low-level vertex geometry derived from the brushes and
patches within the `.map` file. The game engine can then render the mission in
realtime, making use of the same assets that were accessed by DarkRadiant during
editing.

DarkRadiant also maintains its own separate file containing various editing
information, such as object layers used within a map. This `.darkradiant` file
is never used by the game engine, and is non-critical -- a `.map` file with no
accompanying `.darkradiant` file can still be edited with DarkRadiant, although
certain DarkRadiant-specific state may be lost.

=== What's in a MAP?

There are three main types of object contained within a `.map` file: entities,
brushes and patches.

*Entities* are the top-level objects in a map -- essentially, a map file is just a
 list of entities. Every entity has an *entity class* which determines the type
 of entity it is: static mesh, AI, sound emitter, particle emitter, light etc.
 Entities also store a list of string key/value pairs, known as *spawnargs* or
 *properties*. Some entities also contain brushes and patches as children.

*Brushes* are convex solids used to define basic map geometry: walls, floors,
 ceilings, steps and other medium to large items. Brushes are often rectangular
 in shape, although a brush can actually have any number of faces provided that
 it is convex (it is impossible to have a brush in an L or a U shape, for
 example). Brushes are not smooth-shaded by the game engine, which generally
 makes them unsuitable for representing curved surfaces.

*Patches* are smooth one-sided surfaces used to represent curved objects such as
 vaulted ceilings, pillars or cave interiors. A patch is defined by a number of
 Bezier control points, and offers control over the level of detail used when
 subdividing the patch into triangles for rendering: more triangles will produce
 a smoother surface but may lower rendering performance.

The entities, brushes and patches in a map are arranged in a hierarchy: not
every entity has children, but every brush and patch must have an entity as a
parent. Each map therefore starts with a single default entity called the
*worldspawn*, which acts as the parent for new brushes and patches created in
DarkRadiant.

== Initial configuration

=== Choosing a game type

When running DarkRadiant for the first time, the *Game Setup* dialog will be
shown. This is where you configure the path to the game installation from which
DarkRadiant will load assets, such as textures, models and entity definitions.

image::GameSetupDialog.png[align="center"]

The *Game Setup* dialog contains the following options:

*Game Type*:: DarkRadiant ships with support for several different game engines,
 each of which is contained within a `.game` file. For editing Dark Mod
 missions, the default choice of `The Dark Mod 2.0 (Standalone)` is the one to
 use, but it is also possible to edit stock Doom 3 or Quake 4 missions.

*DarkMod Path* / *Engine Path*:: This is the path to the game installation on
 the system. The label text will change depending on whether the selected game
 is `The Dark Mod` or another engine.

*Mission*:: Optional path to a subdirectory containing assets specific to a
 particular mission which is being worked on. For game types other than `The
 Dark Mod`, this will be displayed as *Mod (fs_game)*, and should be set to the
 path of a subdirectory containing a particular game mod, if one is being used.

*Mod Base (fs_game_base)*:: This field only appears for non-DarkMod game types.
 It allows a two-level mod structure, where the *Mod Base* can point to a major
 game mod, possibly downloaded from elsewhere, while *Mod* can be set to point
 to an entirely local "sub-mod" which contains local changes and overrides.
 Before the release of Dark Mod standalone, this field would have been set to
 `darkmod` while the *Mod* field would have been set to the local mission,
 however this is no longer necessary when `The Dark Mod 2.0 (Standalone)` is
 being used.

Once the game paths are set up, click the *Save* button to proceed to the main
DarkRadiant interface.

NOTE: It is possible to *Cancel* the *Game Setup* dialog and proceed to the main
window without configuring a game installation, in which case DarkRadiant will
show a warning and ask if you wish to proceed. If you do, DarkRadiant will run
but there will be no available textures, models, entities or other game assets.

=== Interface layout

DarkRadiant ships with a number of different user interface layouts, which
control the position, visibility and window type of the major interface
elements. The current layout can be changed from the `View -> Window Layout`
menu, and will require DarkRadiant to be restarted.

There is currently no support for custom layouts, however all of the provided
layouts allow window sizes and splitter positions to be changed, and the changes
will persist through multiple editing sessions.

*Embedded*:: A large 2D window is shown on the right, while the left-hand side
 is divided vertically into the 3D camera window and a tab widget containing the
 main editing panels. There are no floating subwindows in this layout.

*Regular*:: A legacy GtkRadiant layout which places the 2D window on the left,
 the 3D camera view on the top right, and a 2D scrolling textures panel on the
 bottom right. Other tabs in the editing panel are shown in a floating window.

*RegularLeft*:: The same as *Regular* except the full-height 2D window is on the
 right and the 3D window and texture panels are on the left.

*Floating*:: The 2D window, 3D window and editing tab widget are all shown in
 separate floating windows which always appear above the main DarkRadiant
 window. The main window itself is empty apart from the toolbars and status bar.
 This is the most flexible layout, since each subwindow can be sized or
 positioned as desired, but the multiple subwindows may be cumbersome to manage.

*SplitPane*:: Three separate 2D windows, showing each of the major axes, are
 shown alongside the 3D camera view in a 2x2 layout similar to traditional 3D
 modelling applications. The editing tab widget is in a floating window.

=== Colour schemes

DarkRadiant defaults to a black-on-white colour scheme in the 2D windows, but
ships with four other colour schemes, which can be accessed under `View ->
Colours...`. If you prefer a dark theme, the `Black & Green` scheme might be
suitable, whereas the `Maya/Max/Lightwave Emulation` and `Super Mal` themes
provide a more neutral, low-contrast look.

Each of the colour schemes can be edited using the colour selector buttons in
the *Colours* dialog, and it is also possible to copy one of the default schemes
into a custom scheme with a new name.

== Basic editing

=== Navigating the 2D view

The game world is a three-dimensional vector space with a central origin,
rendered in the 2D editing window as a grid. The unit of measurement is an
arbitrary game unit which does not directly correspond to any real-world
measurement system -- in The Dark Mod, a typical human stands around 80 - 90
game units high, making a game unit about 2 cm.

Each 2D window shows which axes it is representing with an icon in the top-left
corner, as well as an identical icon at the `<0,0,0>` origin position, if
visible within the view.

.Components of the 2D view
image::2DViewMarkedUp.png[align="center"]

The 2D view also shows the current position of the camera (used for rendering
the separate 3D camera view window), and its view direction.

The following commands are available within the 2D view:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|*Right drag*|Scroll the view horizontally or vertically
|*Mouse wheel*|Zoom the view
|*Shift + Right drag*|Zoom the view (alternative binding)
|*Ctrl + Middle click*|Move the camera directly to the clicked position
|*Middle click*|Rotate the camera to look directly at the clicked point
|*Ctrl + TAB*|Change view axis (XY, XZ, YZ)
|*Ctrl + Shift + TAB*|Center 2D view on current camera position
|===

=== Adjusting the grid

The grid shown in the 2D view is used to snap the position and size of brushes
and patches, as well as the centerpoints of entities. The size of the grid can
be configured, in powers of 2, from 0.125 up to 256, using the *1-9* keys on the
main keyboard (not the numeric keypad), or the equivalent options in the *Grid*
menu.

The *0* key on the main keyboard can be used to toggle the display of the grid.
Note that objects will still be snapped to the grid even if the grid is not
visible; this is purely a visual toggle.

IMPORTANT: Level geometry built from brushes and patches should _always_ be
snapped to the grid to avoid problems such as rendering glitches and map leaks.
Static meshes and animated AI can be positioned more freely, however grid
snapping is a useful tool for ensuring that models are appropriately aligned
with the level geometry.

=== Using the 3D camera view

The 3D camera view provides an approximate rendering of the map in three
dimensions, in several different render modes: wireframe, flat shaded, textured,
and fully lit by in-game light sources. While the 2D view is the main interface
for creating and aligning level geometry, the 3D view is a vital tool for tasks
such as texturing, or configuring light parameters.

IMPORTANT: The fully lit rendering mode in DarkRadiant is very limited, and only
offers a partial view of what the game engine will ultimately render. In
particular, there are no shadows or foglights.

The 3D view always renders the scene from a particular camera position, which is
shown in the 2D view as a blue diamond. This camera position can be set directly
from the 2D view with *Ctrl + Middle click*, and the camera view direction can
be set with *Middle click*. There are also various options within the 3D view
itself to adjust the camera position.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|*Right click*|Enter or leave free camera mode. In this mode, moving the mouse
around updates the camera view direction in real-time, and moving the mouse
around while holding *Ctrl* causes the camera to move up/down/left/right
according to the camera motion.
2+^s|Default mode (not free camera)
|*Left/Right arrow*|Pan the camera left or right
|*Up/Down arrow*|Move the camera forwards or backwards on the horizontal plane,
without changing its height on the Z axis.
2+^s|Free camera mode
|*Left/Right arrow*|Move ("truck") camera left or right, leaving view direction
the same.
|*Up/Down arrow*|Move ("dolly") the camera forwards or backwards along its view
axis

|===

=== Manipulating objects

Every object in a map can be selected and moved within the 2D view. Some objects
-- including brushes, patches and lights -- can also be resized.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|*Shift + Left click*|Select or deselect the object at the clicked position. Any
  existing selected objects will remain selected. If the clicked position
  overlaps more than one object, the closest one (according to the current 2D
  view axis) will be affected.
|*Alt + Shift + Left click*|Select the object at the clicked position, and
  deselect any existing selected objects. If the clicked position overlaps more
  than one object, each click will cycle through the overlapping objects.
|*ESC*|Deselect all objects
|*Left drag* _inside_ a selected object|Move the selected object(s)
|*Left drag* _outside_ a selected object|Resize the selected object(s) (if available)
|*Space*|Duplicate the selected object(s)
|*Backspace*|Delete the selected object(s)
|===

TIP: Like other editors in the Radiant family, DarkRadiant offers a rather
unusual system for resizing objects. Rather than clicking exactly on the edge,
or on a dedicated resizing handle, you can click and drag anywhere outside an
edge to move that edge inwards or outwards. Dragging outside a corner allows you
to move two edges at once.

=== Working with brushes

Brushes are the basic building blocks of all maps. Typically they are used for
coarse-grained level geometry such as walls, ceiling and floors. Brushes also
have a vital role in sealing a map from the void: even a map built entirely from
patches and static meshes must still be surrounded by brushes in order to avoid
leaking.

.Additive versus subtractive geometry
****
If you are used to mapping for the legacy Thief games using Dromed or T3Edit,
the system used by DarkRadiant may seem somewhat back-to-front. In previous
games, the world starts out as an infinite solid, in which you "carve out" rooms
using subtractive brushes. In DarkRadiant, the world starts out as an infinite
void, and all brushes are solid. The space in which the mission happens must be
fully enclosed by solid brushes, otherwise the map will "leak" and fail to
compile.

The need to deal with map leaks may at first seem like a burden, however the
exclusive use of solid brushes frees the engine from needing to worry about
"brush ordering", and allows an important performance optimisation: by "flood
filling" the map interior, the map compiler can efficiently discard geometry
that never needs to be rendered.
****

[[CreatingABrush]]
==== Creating a brush

To create a simple rectangular brush, ensure that nothing is selected (*ESC*),
then *Left drag* in the 2D view. A new brush will be created and sized according
to the dragged area, with its dimensions snapped to the current grid level. To
adjust the third dimension of the brush (perpendicular to the view direction),
used *Ctrl + TAB* to switch the 2D view axis, and *Left drag* outside the brush
boundary to adjust the size.

TIP: Whenever you drag to create a new brush, the third dimension will match the
size of the _most recently selected_ brush. This makes it easy to draw a series
of brushes with the same height, such as when you need to create a series of
floors or walls in succession. To match the height of an existing brush, simply
select (*Shift + Left click*) and deselect it (*ESC*) before drawing the new
brush.

==== More complex brush shapes

Although each brush starts out as a six-sided cuboid, it doesn't have to stay
that way. DarkRadiant offers several options for creating multi-sided brushes in
more complex shapes. To create one of these shapes, first define a regular
cuboid brush covering the volume you want the new shape to occupy, then choose
the appropriate option from the *Brush* menu:

[%autowidth]
|===
|image:6Prism.png[]|
*Prism*

An n-sided approximation of a cylinder, with the axis of the cylinder
 aligned with the current 2D view.

|image:6Cone.png[]|
*Cone*

A tapered n-sided cone, which always points upwards regardless of the
2D view axis.

|image:6Sphere.png[]|
*Sphere*

A rotationally symmetric n-sided approximation of a sphere, with the
axis of rotation pointing upwards.
|===

While these shapes can be useful for certain architectural modelling, remember
that brushes are always flat-shaded and are not generally a good substitute for
spheres or cones created with patches or static meshes.

==== Creating a room

Although it is not too difficult to create a hollow room by creating floor,
ceiling and wall brushes manually, this is a common enough operation that
DarkRadiant provides a couple of shortcuts. These options can be found on the
vertical toolbar at the far left of the main window.

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|image:CreateRoomBrush.png[width=320]|
image:CreateRoom.png[width=36] *Create Room*

Create a room whose interior size matches the size of the currently-selected
brush. The wall thickness will be equal to the current grid size.

|image:HollowBrush.png[width=320]|
image:Hollow.png[width=36] *Hollow*

Hollow out the selected brush, leaving the exterior dimensions the same. The
wall thickness will be equal to the current grid size, but the wall brushes will
overlap at the corners, rather than just touching each other as with *Create
Room*.

This is legacy tool from GtkRadiant, and generally inferior to *Create Room*.
The overlapping wall brushes make it more difficult to precisely align interior
textures, since part of the inner face is obscured (and therefore removed during
map compilation). However, there may be occasional situations in which *Hollow*
is useful, so it is retained in DarkRadiant.
|===

The room creation tools do not require the initial brush to be rectangular --
you can quite happily *Create Room* with a triangular or trapezoidal brush, or a
brush with sloping sides. However, with a more complex brush shape, the
complexity of the resulting wall geometry increases considerably, so attempting
to hollow out a 7-sided sphere is probably ill-advised.

==== Splitting brushes

Sometimes it is necessary to divide a brush into two or more pieces, perhaps to
create a doorway or other opening. The *Clipper* tool, accessed with the *X*
key, is used for this purpose.

.Splitting a brush into two parts
image::ClipTool3D.png[align="center"]

. Select the brush to be split (the Clipper can be activated with nothing
selected, but it will not do anything useful).
. Press *X* to activate the Clipper, or click on the respective icon on the
left-hand editing toolbar.
. Click in the 2D window at two different positions, to define the plane along
which the brush will be split. The proposed split plane will be highlighted in
blue; feel free to change 2D view axis with *Ctrl + TAB* or use the 3D camera view
to better visualise the split plane.
. Once the split plane is defined, press *Shift + Enter* to execute the split and
keep _both_ halves of the brush; press *Enter* to execute the split and keep
only one half. The part of the brush that is kept with *Enter* depends on the
order in which you define the clip points: the points (marked *0* and *1*) will
appear _clockwise_ on the brush edge according to the current 2D view. If in
doubt, just use *Shift + Enter* to keep both parts, and delete the unwanted one
afterwards.
. Repeat the process to perform additional splits on the selected brush, or
disable the Clipper with the *X* key. The Clipper is a toggled tool and will
remain active until disabled.

NOTE: It is possible to create _three_ split points before executing the split,
which will define a split plane in three dimensions. Defining a three-point
split plane which is actually useful, however, may be challenging.

==== Reshaping brush edges

All brush edges can be moved independently, which gives you the ability to
quickly create shapes like triangles or trapeziums. This functionality is
accessed via the *Select Edges* tool on the upper toolbar, or with the *E* key.

.Creating a trapezium using edge editing
image::EdgeEditing.png[align="center"]

. Select a brush.
. Activate *Select Edges* with the toolbar button or *E* key. DarkRadiant will
place a green control point at the center of each brush edge.
. In either the 2D or the 3D view, click and drag on a control point to move its
edge. The control point will turn blue and move along with the cursor. In the 2D
view, dragging corners is generally easiest, since the resulting shape change
can more easily be seen.
. To reduce the number of brush sides, such as changing a rectangle into a
triangle, simply drag one corner directly on top of another. The two edges will
be merged.

==== Applying textures to brushes

There are two separate interfaces for browsing and applying textures, each of
which provides similar functionality but presents the information in a slightly
different way.

The *Media* tab shows a tree view which contains all of the textures available
within the game installation. Selecting a texture in the tree will show a small
preview swatch in the widget at the bottom of the panel, along with some
metadata about the texture definition. To apply a texture to the selected brush,
either *Double-click* on a texture name in the tree, or *Right-click* and choose
*Apply to selection*.

The *Textures* tab provides a scrollable canvas containing preview swatches of
all the textures which are currently loaded. When DarkRadiant first starts up,
no textures are loaded and this panel is empty; to load a texture you must
either apply it to a brush directly from the *Media* tab, or use the *Media*
tab's context menu to *Load in Textures view* (this command can be applied to an
individual texture or an entire folder). To apply a texture from the *Textures*
tab, simply *Left-click* on the texture preview with one or more brushes
selected.

You can control which faces of a brush are textured by choosing the appropriate
selection commmand:

- Selecting a brush with *Shift + Left click*, which works in any 2D or 3D view,
  will select the entire brush. Any applied texture will apply to all faces.
- In the 3D view, use *Ctrl + Shift + Left click* to select or deselect a
  particular brush face. This works best when the entire brush is _not_ already
  selected with *Shift + Left click*. Each selected brush face will be rendered
  with a red-coloured overlay, and any texture operation will apply only to the
  selected faces.

=== Working with entities

If brushes are the bricks and mortar of a map (often literally), entities are
its fixtures and fittings. Every object in a map which "does something" other
than form part of the level geometry is an entity: lights, audio speakers,
particle emitters, static meshes, animated creatures or machinery. There are
also various functional entity types which provide vital metadata to the game
engine, such as determining where the player should start, or how creatures
should navigate between locations.

DarkRadiant provides certain common functionality to all entities, such as the
ability to edit properties using the *Entity* tab. Particular entity types are
sufficiently common, however, that they have their own dedicated creation and
editing tools.

*Light*:: Every map requires at least one light source in order to render
anything in game. A light occupies a rectangular volume, which can be created
and resized much like a brush, and has properties to determine its colour,
visible shape and falloff pattern in three dimensions. Lights can optionally
cast shadows, and can even be animated to flicker or flash.

*Model (func_static)*:: Model entities represent geometry that is not compiled
as part of the map itself. The model geometry can either be derived from brushes
and patches created inside DarkRadiant, or from an external model file in ASE or
LWO format. Model files are the primary mechanism for including fine detail in a
map which would be cumbersome to create with brushes and patches.

*Speaker*:: Essentially the audio equivalent of a light, a speaker entity
represents the point from which an in-game sound source will emanate. It has
properties to control its size and falloff, and optionally override certain
properties of the sound shader itself, such as volume.

*Player start (info_player_start)*:: This entity tells the game engine where to
place the player when a map is first loaded. A map without such an entity will
not be playable.

==== Creating lights

To create a light, *Right click* in the 2D view and choose *Create light…*.
The position and size of the light volume depends on the current selection:

- If _nothing_ is selected, then a light volume will be created at the clicked
  position with a default size.
- If a _single brush_ is selected, the brush will be deleted and the light
  volume will match the size and position of the brush.
- If _several brushes_ are selected, then all selected brushes will be deleted
  and the light volume will be sized according to the bounding box of the
  brushes (i.e. the smallest box that would contain all of the brushes).

Unselected lights are shown in the 2D view as small boxes, while selected lights
also show the boundaries of the light volume.

.Light entity selected (left) and unselected (right)
image::LightSelectedAndUnselected.png[align="center"]

A selected light entity can be moved by dragging inside the small center box,
and it can be resized by dragging outside the edge of the light volume. Unlike
brushes, light volumes will by default resize symmetrically, so that the center
point does not move during the resize.

NOTE: Although light volumes can be resized like brushes, their shape can never
be changed; every light is an axis-aligned cuboid. This does not, however, mean
that they need to _look_ rectangular in game. See the <<LightInspector,next
section>> for details on how to change the falloff texture using the light
inspector.

There are a couple of options on the top toolbar which control the display and
behaviour of light volumes:

[cols="1,3,10"]
|===
a|image::view_show_lightradii.png[align="center",width=24]|*Show all light volumes*|
If enabled, light volume boundaries will be rendered in the 2D view for _all_
light entities, not just selected entities. The default behaviour is to show
only the center box for unselected light entities.
a|image::dragresize_symm.png[align="center",width=24]|*Drag-resize entities symmetrically*|
If enabled (the default), light entities will be resized symmetrically, without
moving the center point. If disabled, lights will be resized like brushes:
dragging an edge will move only that edge, while the opposite edge remains
fixed.
|===

[[LightInspector]]
===== The light inspector

When initially created, a light is pure white in colour and has an unrealistic
rectangular illumination pattern matching its shape. You can change these
properties using the light inspector, which is accessed with the *L* key.

image::LightInspector.png[align="center"]

*Light volume (omni vs projected)*:: The majority of lights in a map will be the
default, omnidirectional shape. An omni light is a simple axis-aligned cuboid
which emits light in all directions from its center to its edges.
+
A projected light is pyramid-shaped, and emits light from the tip of the pyramid
towards the base. Projected lights behave more like spotlights in real-life, and
can be used to highlight particular areas or project images of windows onto the
floor.

*Colour*:: Use the colour selector button to display a standard colour selection
dialog, or enter the RGB values directly using the text box. As well as changing
the hue, the light colour also governs the overall brightness of the light.

*Texture*:: The falloff texture controls the shape of the lit area when rendered
in-game; the square texture chosen here will be mapped directly onto the
rectangular shape of the light volume. Light textures can be simple, such as the
generic circular gradient of `biground1`, or much more complex, including
multiple colours or animation.

*Options*:: There are a few light-propagation options which are mostly used to
 tweak performance. In particular, disabling shadows for any light which does
 not actually _need_ to cast shadows can give a significant boost to rendering
 speed.

[[CreatingModels]]
==== Creating models

Static models can be used to provide fine details in a map which would be
difficult or impossible to create in the editor with brushes or patches. Models
are created with an external 3D application such as Blender, Lightwave or Maya,
and saved into the game asset tree in LWO or ASE format.

To insert a model, ensure that nothing is selected, then *Right click* in the 2D
view and choose *Create model…*. DarkRadiant will show the model selector
dialog:

image::ModelSelector.png[align="center"]

In the top-left of the model selector window is a tree of all available models
in the game installation. Models may have different _skins_, which are variants
of the same model with different textures applied. If a model has skins
available, these will be listed as children of the model entry in the tree.

Choosing a model or one of its skins will show a preview render in the large
widget on the right-hand side. Various metadata such as the polygon count and
the applied textures are also shown in table at the lower left.

When you have chosen the desired model, click *OK* to insert it into the map.
The model will be inserted at the position where you originally right-clicked to
show the model chooser.

==== Creating a player start marker

The game requires a special entity (`info_player_start`) to mark the position at
which the player should enter the map. Without such an entity the map will be
unplayable.

To create this entity, ensure that nothing is selected then *Right click* in the
2D view and choose *Create player start here*. DarkRadiant will create the
player start entity at the clicked position.

Since it makes no sense to have more than one player start location, DarkRadiant
will not enable the *Create player start here* menu option if there is already
an `info_player_start` in the map. Instead, you may choose *Move player start
here* to move the existing entity to the clicked position.

==== Creating other entity types

Entity types without a dedicated item in the right-click menu are created using
the generic *Create entity…* option, which displays a dialog very similar to the
<<CreatingModels,model selector>>:

image::EntityClassSelector.png[align="center"]

Just like the model selector, the entity selector displays a tree of all
available entity types in the game installation, and a large preview widget
which shows an approximate rendering of the entity, if appropriate. Purely
functional entity types such as `info_location` or `info_player_start` do not
have any visible appearance and their render preview will be blank.

Some entity types have a short textual description giving information about
their usage; if present, this is displayed in the text box underneath the entity
class tree.

After selecting the desired entity type in the tree, click the *Add* button to
insert an instance of the entity into the map at the right-clicked location. If
the selected entity type requires a brush selection and no brush is selected, a
warning will be shown at this point.

==== Editing entity properties

Every entity has a list of key/value pairs known as _properties_ or _spawnargs_.
These properties are displayed on the *Entity* tab of the editing panel.

image::EntityInspector.png[align="center"]

The entity panel lists all of the properties of the currently-selected entity,
showing each property's name, its current value, and an icon representing its
type (boolean, vector, text etc) if known. Selecting a property will populate
the two text boxes in the center of the widget with the property name and value,
allowing the value to be edited. If the selected property is of a known type,
the panel at the bottom will show a custom widget appropriate for editing the
particular property, e.g. three separate numeric spinboxes for a vector
property, a colour selector widget for a colour property, and so on.

*Changing a property value*:: To change the value of the selected property,
 simply enter the new value in the lower text box, then hit *Enter* or click the
 green tick button. If the property has a type-specific editing widget, you can
 also change its value using the controls in this widget.

*Adding a new property*:: There are two different ways to add a new property:
. Enter a new property name in the upper text box (which shows the selected
property name), and hit *Enter*. This does not rename the selected property, but
adds a new property with the edited name and the current value.
. *Right click* in the list of properties and choose *Add property* from the
context menu. This will display a new dialog listing all known properties along
with their descriptive text (if available). Selecting a property in this dialog
and choosing *OK* will add the property to the entity with a default value of
"-", which can then be edited in the entity panel itself.

*Deleting a property*:: To delete the selected property, *Right click* on the
 property in the list and choose *Delete property*.

The entity panel provides two options controlling its behaviour:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|*Show inherited properties*|If checked, all properties that apply to the
selected entity will be shown, including those which are inherited from the
entity type declaration in the game installation. If unchecked, only those
properties explicitly set on this particular entity (and stored in the map file)
will be shown.

You can change the value of an inherited property by selecting it and entering a
new value in the entity panel; this will create a new explicit property on the
entity which overrides the inherited default.
|*Show help*|Enables or disables the text widget at the bottom of the panel
which shows a brief explanation of certain properties. If a property has help
text available, the question mark icon will be shown in the *?* column.

=== Working with patches

Patches are smooth-shaded Bezier surfaces that can be created and manipulated in
the editor (unlike models), and used to represent a variety of curved shapes
such as vaulted ceilings, arches or pillars. Patches are single-sided surfaces,
not solid like brushes, and cannot be used to seal a map from the void -- any
patch work on the boundary of a map will need solid brushes behind it to prevent
the map from leaking.

==== Creating a simple patch

A simple patch starts off as a flat rectangle, which can then be manipulated
with vertex editing to produce a curved surface, if desired.

To create a simple patch:

. Set the 2D view axes (*Ctrl + TAB*) to define the orientation of the patch.
The patch will be created facing directly towards the screen, so to create a
horizontal (ceiling or floor) patch, the 2D view should be in XY (Top)
orientation.
. <<CreatingABrush,Create a rectangular brush>> to define the width and height of
the patch in the current 2D view (the third dimension is not important, since
the patch will be infinitely thin once created).
. With the brush selected, choose *Create Simple Patch Mesh* from the *Patch*
menu.
. In the dialog, choose the number of control points to define the shape of the
patch along its width and height. A patch can have between 3 and 15 control
points in each dimension; there will always be a control point at the extreme
edge, and one in the middle. More control points allow more complex shapes but
also require more manual adjustment -- creating a simple arch is much easier
with just three control points.
. Click *OK* to create the patch.

==== Manipulating control points

With a patch selected, press *V* to enter (or leave) vertex editing mode. This
will display all of the control vertices, and allow you to select and move them.

- *Left click* and drag a vertex to move just that one vertex.
- *Shift + Left click* to add a vertex to the current selection set. When
   several vertices are selected, dragging any one of the selected vertices will
   move all of them together.
- *Shift + Left drag* around several vertices to draw a selection rectangle that
   will toggle the selection state of all vertices inside it, selecting them if
   unselected and unselecting them if already selected.

==== More complex patch shapes

Just like with brushes, DarkRadiant offers several default patch shapes beyond
the flat simple patch. These can be created by choosing the corresponding option
in the *Patch* menu. There is no need to have a brush selected first in order to
create these shapes, however if a brush _is_ selected, it will be removed and
used to define the size of the patch shape.

*Sphere*

An approximation of a sphere (the quadratic Bezier patch implementation in Doom
3 and DarkRadiant does not permit the creation of a perfect sphere).

|image:PatchCylinder.png[]|
*Cylinder*

A hollow cylinder aligned with the direction of the 2D view.

|image:PatchCone.png[]|
*Cone*

A tapered cone pointing along the 2D view axis.

|image:PatchEndCap.png[]|
*End cap*

An arch or half-cylinder covering a 180 degree angle, aligned with the 2D view
axis. The peak of the arch will be at the top if created in front or side views,
making this useful for curved ceilings and the like.

|image:PatchBevel.png[]|
*Bevel*

Portion of an arch covering a 90 degree angle. This may be placed along room
edges to give a curved appearance.
